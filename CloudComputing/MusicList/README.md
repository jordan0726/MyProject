## üöÄ Getting Started (for Team Members)

### üîê AWS Credentials Setup

For team members using PyCharm (or any other IDE ‚Äî as long as the **AWS Toolkit plugin** is installed):

1. **Launch your AWS Academy Learner Lab**  
   (via Canvas or AWS Educate dashboard)

2. **Open AWS Toolkit ‚Üí Edit AWS Credentials File** in your IDE.

3. **Paste your credentials** from the Learner Lab into the credentials file:

> üîç You can find your temporary credentials in the Learner Lab interface.  
> For more details, refer to **Week 3 Lab instructions**.

<pre><code>[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
aws_session_token = YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN
</code></pre>

4. **Verify successful connection**  
   Once configured correctly, you should see AWS services (like DynamoDB and S3) listed in the AWS Toolkit sidebar:

### üì• Required Project Files

Make sure the following files are present in your working directory:

- `main.py`
- `dynamo_manager.py`
- `s3_manager.py`
- `2025a1.json` (data source)

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Program

Once your AWS connection is set:

You can run the project in your local environment
This will:
    1. Create a DynamoDB table automatically
    2. Load and populate data from 2025a1.json into the table
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently, data insertion is done one-by-one, so performance might be slow for large datasets. Haven't refined it yet.
